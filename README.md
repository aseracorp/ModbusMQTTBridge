## Home Assistant Addon: Modbus MQTT Bridge

'Modbus MQTT Bridge' is a Home Assistant add-on that allows users to easily add Modbus devices to their Home Assistant instance using a simple user interface. This add-on provides a way to connect USB Modbus devices to Home Assistant via MQTT, which can be easily integrated with other devices and sensors.

# Adding Custom Devices

If a device is not yet supported by Modbus MQTT Bridge, you can create a custom device by adding a folder named "custom-modbus-devices" and adding a custom YAML configuration for your device. The folder should be added to the /config directory in your Home Assistant installation.

The structure of the YAML configuration file can be seen here:

```yaml

company_name: ORNO
product_name: OR-WE-517
